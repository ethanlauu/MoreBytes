      MoreBytes was inspired by a pressing issue we observed in our community, the Bay Area, where a stark contrast between food waste in affluent areas and food insecurity in less fortunate neighborhoods was evident. In areas with high concentrations of wealth, food purchases are skyrocketing but consumption does not follow suit. As a result, food waste is a common practice in almost every household, caused by a lack of alternatives and lack of financial need, especially in areas like Fremont. On the flip side, in less fortunate areas, thousands of people lack access to food, and have no way to do so. We, at MoreBytes, aim to build the bridge between those living miles down the road from those who need food, eliminating the barrier that was set before. We hope to reduce food waste and reallocate this food to those who need it the most.
